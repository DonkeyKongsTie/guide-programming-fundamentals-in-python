# header 1
## header 2
### header 3

This is a paragraph, look at me.

I am a list:

- itm 1
- itm 2
- itm 3

I am a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3



I need some `inline code` up in here.

Maybe a block to:

```
var this = that;
```

But with syntax highlighting it's better:

```js
var this = that;
```
